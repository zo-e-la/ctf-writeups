## Overview 
**[WACTF 0x05](https://wac.tf/)** is a two day CTF in WA. It involved a number of categories including: 
1. Web Application
2. Exploitation
3. Cryptography
4. Active Directory
5. Incident Response
6. Miscellaneous 

My focus was on Web Application and at the end I tried a Exploitation challenge (but ran out of time).
