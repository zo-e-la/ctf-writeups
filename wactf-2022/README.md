## Overview 
WACTF 0x05 is a two day CTF in WA. It involved a number of categories including: 
1. Web Application
2. Exploitation
3. Cryptography
4. Active Directory
5. Incident Response
6. Miscellaneous 
My focus was on Web Application and at the end I tried some Exploitation (however I ran out of time).

> Each folder is a challenge I completed. This is my second ctf so I am still learning! Happy I found two flags (with the help of my teammates).
