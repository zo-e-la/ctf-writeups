#### ranking 
<sub>This was a competition located outside of our team's geographical locations therefore we were not elligible for prizes -- so there was a different ranking depending on if groups were located in WA despite differing collective team points.</sub>

#### notes 
Each folder is a challenge I completed. This is my second ctf so I am still learning! Happy I could have gotten two flags (with the help of my teammates).
